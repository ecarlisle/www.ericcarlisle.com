<p>
	Ready to have your mind blown? Meet Flexbox! The Flexbox (or Flexible Box) Layout Model is a set of CSS attributes that will likely change the way you think about UI layouts. Flexbox uses a dual-axis, container/item layout model allowing for powerful approaches to element space distribution, alignment, and sizing. This can be a tremendous boon for web projects with dynamic data and design flux. It may also tremendously simplify responsive layouts that are dependent on commonly complicated grid models.
