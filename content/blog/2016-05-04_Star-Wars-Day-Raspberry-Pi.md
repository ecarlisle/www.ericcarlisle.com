Happy Star Wars day! Let's have some fandom fun! :-)

Let's start with one of [Raspberry Pi's](https://www.raspberrypi.org/) newest innovations, [The Raspberry Pi Zero](https://www.raspberrypi.org/products/pi-zero/). Next let's encase it with a few hundred Nanoblocks in a shape befitting said Star Wars fandom. Geekery ensues!

While this is some scifi fun and I am admittedly showing off a bit. I send this out as a salute to the [Raspberry Pi Foundation](https://www.raspberrypi.org).  The Pi Foundation inspires global educational empowerment with the creation of low-cost computer hardware. Just when I think The Pi Foundation couldn't inspire me more, they blow me away again with a $5 computer board. That's right, five dollars. With the addition of some peripherals and adapters, the Zero can be made into a human-usable computer system at an ashtonishingly low cost.

BTW, please don't read into my choice of spacecraft as a reflection of anything Pi. I doubt that the Pi Foundation is filled with Sith Lords with ambitions for intergallactic domination.  I chose a recognizable build that didn't hide the board. The hanger bay below also helps heat escape when executing intense Hyperspace programs!
